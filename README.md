# Catch-The_Box
  This is my first attempt at an unreal engine game.
This game is based on an old HTML game of mine called Bouncing Box in which you would click on the box and it would change colors and it would respawn somewhere else.
This is a Multiplayer game where you and a friend chase a box and try to catch it. When you catch it, it will respawn somewhere else and you get a point. The first to 5 points or at the end of 5 minutes.
